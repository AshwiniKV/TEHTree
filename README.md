# TEHTree

Treatment effect heterogeneity occurs when individual characteristics influence the effect of a treatment. We propose a novel approach that combines prognostic score matching and conditional inference trees to characterize effect heterogeneity of a randomized binary treatment. One key feature that distinguishes our method from alternative approaches is that it controls the Type I error rate, i.e., the probability of identifying effect heterogeneity if none exists and retains the underlying subgroups.
